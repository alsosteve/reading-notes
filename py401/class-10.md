# Read: Data Structure and Analysis - Stacks & Queues
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes.

## Stacks

### Vocab:
`Push` - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
`Pop` - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to `pop` an empty stack an exception will be raised.
`Top` - This is the top of the stack.
`Peek` - When you `peek` you will view the value of the `top` Node in the stack. When you attempt to `peek` an empty stack an exception will be raised.
`IsEmpty` - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

### Types of stacks:

#### FILO - First In Last Out
- first item added in the stack will be the last item out of the stack.

#### LIFO - Last In First Out
- last item added to the stack will be the first item out of the stack


## Queue

### Vocab:
`Enqueue` - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
`Dequeue` - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the `queue` is empty an exception will be raised.
`Front` - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
`Rear` - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
`Peek` - When you `peek` you will view the value of the `front` Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
`IsEmpty` - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

### Types of queues:

#### FILO - First In Last Out
- irst item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

#### LIFO - Last In First Out
- last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
