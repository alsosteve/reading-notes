## [Dunder Methods](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)
- dunder/"magic" methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types
### Object Initialization: `__init__`
- cunstructor that takes care of setting up the object

### Object Representation: `__str__`, `__repr__`
`__repr__`: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous.

`__str__`: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.

### Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__
### Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: __eq__, __lt__
### Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: __add__
### Callable Python Objects: __call__
### Context Manager Support and the With Statement: __enter__, __exit__

## [Statistics - Probability](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/basic-statistics-in-python-probability/)
### Probability
> At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur. The quintessential representation of probability is the humble coin toss.
