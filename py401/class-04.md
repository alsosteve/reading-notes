# Read: 04 - Variables, Recursion, & Pytest

## [Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)
Classes are a template to create your objects.
Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes.

## [Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)
The typical structure of a recursive algorithm. If the current problem represents a simple case, solve it. If not, divide it into subproblems and apply the same strategy to them.
- You need to maintain state by having a global state or thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current callâ€™s execution context
