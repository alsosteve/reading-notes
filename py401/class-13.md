## [How to Run Linear Regression in Python](http://bigdata-madesimple.com/how-to-run-linear-regression-in-python-scikit-learn/)
 linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables 
Scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning. 
In linear regressions, Y represents the depending variable and X represents the independent variable(s).

Important functions:

* lm.fit() - fits a linear model
* lm.predict() - Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients.
* lm.score() - Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2)
* lm.coef_&lm.intercept_ - give the coefficients and estimated intercepts of a model.

* Residual plots - can be used to visualize errors in data.
