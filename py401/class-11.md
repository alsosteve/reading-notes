## [What is Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)
> JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

- enables you to work with documents and activities like Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components
- "lexible, integrated, and extensible"
- use abs and splitters to view documents and activities side by side
- a unified model for viewing and handling data formats

- `Code Consoles` provide transient scratchpads for running code
  -can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.

- `Kernel-backed documents` enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.

- `Notebook cell outputs` can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.

- Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.
