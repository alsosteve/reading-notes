## [Pain and Suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)
- The article goes over the relationship between pain/suffering and growth
-basically reiterates the growth mindset but in a way that makes it feel like the writer knows you’re going to complain about how hard the courses and this is the reason why we set the course up like this


## [Beginners Guide to Big O](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation)
- Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

### O(1)
- an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

### O(N)
- describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

### O(N²)
-  represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set

### O(2^N)
- denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

### Logarithms: O(log N)
