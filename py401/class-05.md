# Read: 05 - Linked Lists
Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
- Nodes are how each set of data is referenced
- They are recursive in nature
- Links data together in a dynamic and orderly way

Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function.
- A way to measure rate of growth/complexity
- Measures efficiency in terms of time but also resources (I.E memory usage)
  * Three measurements of time:
  * milliseconds from start of execution to the end
  * number of operations
  * number of basic operations
- Orders of growth
  * Describes the rate of time/space complexity
  * logarithmic growth
  * algorithmic growth
