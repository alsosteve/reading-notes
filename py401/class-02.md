## [In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932?gi=852af64541e6)
- Tests help you analyze the input, output, and behavior of your code.
- **_Test-Driven Development_**: strategy to write tests first
- TDD is to craft the software design first
- creates more reliable code
- test name should describe test in deatail
### **_AAA or Arrange, Act, and Assert_**:
- **_Arrange_**: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
- **_Act_**: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
- **_Assert_**: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.
### **_Three step test cycle_**:
1. Write a failing - test shouuld fail
2. Write a feature and run it through the test - test should pass by the end of this step
3. Refactor the Code - make it look nice
