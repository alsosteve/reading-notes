## Text Editors
There are a lot of text editors to choose from. Luckily we are all pretty similar. You just have to learn the different features of each and weigh the pros and cons, but also keep in mind what is currently being used in the industry. A __*Text Editor*__ is software that you download or is on a mobile platform that lets you write text to be posted on the website. It’s the bread and butter of web development. According to the article, [*Choosing A Text Editor*](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf), you should ,ook for the following:

> 1. code completion
> 2. syntax highlighting
> 3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue)
> 4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.

### Code Completion
*__Code completion__* is like auto text in cell phones but for text editors. They work by generating a list of possible inputs that you were about to type and provide a list for you to choose from. They are a great way to save time because they complete inputs without you having to type out the whole time. Another type of code completion is shorthand code.

### Syntax Highlighting
__*Syntax Highlighting*__ is when your text editor highlights different elements of your code automatically according to what kind of element it is. It also can detect errors. This makes typing out your own code a lot easier because it automatically differentiates text elements. Just like how headers differentiate sections you’re reading syntax highlighting brings attention to certain sections of your code.
