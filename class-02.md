## HTML & CSS

### Text

Wgen you make a web page, use mark-up tags to emphasize sertaint content within the text. **_Structural Markup_** is used to describe headings and pharagraphs. **_Semantic Markuo_** is used to provide extra emphasisin a sentance.

#### Headings 
HTML has 6 levels of headings. The **<h1>** tag is ised for main headings. **<h2>** is used for subheadings. The rest are used to further divide sections of your web page as you see fit.

#### Paragraphs
Pharagraphs are identified with the **<p>** tag. New paragraphs automatically start on a new line with some spacing inbetween it and the last paragraph.

#### Emphasis
**_Bold_** elements are found in the **<b>** tag.
**_Italics_** are inserted with the **<i>** tag.
The **_Strong_** element tag is **<stronh>** it indicates a strong importance in text.
the **<em>** tag creates **_emphasis_** in a sentance that subtly changes its meaning.

#### Superscript & Subscript
The **<sup>** element creates superscript.
The **<sub>** element creates a subscript.

#### White Space
Programmers use extra spaces and page breaks to make the code easy to read. HTML ignores the extra spaces and counts them as one space, also known as **White Space Collapsing**.

#### Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
Use the **<br />** tag to add a line break in the middle of a paragraph.
the **<hr />** tag inserts a horizontal rule in the page.

#### Quotes & References
**_Blockquotes_**- the **<blockquote>** tag is used to highlight quotes longer than a pharagraph. They are also usually indented.
**_Quotes_**- the **<q>** tag is used for smaller quotes that sit within a pharagraph.
**_Citations_**- use **<cite>** tag to indicate where a citation is from.

### Introducing CSS

CSS works by changing the way elements within certaint tags look in HTML.
