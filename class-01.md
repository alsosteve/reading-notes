## Read: 01 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript

### HTML & CSS

#### Structure
  - Tags- they include an opening and closing tag. They are like containers for the information inbetween the opening and closing tags.
  - Attributes- they provide extra information about the contents within the designated tags. They are inserted into the opening tag. Attributes include an atribute name and an attribute value. The name identifies what is being changed in the element and the value is what kind of change is being made.

  - Body- The <Body> tag contains elements in the main browser window.
  - Head- The <head> tag is where you put information about a page. For example, the title element is found within the head tag.
  - Tittle- the <title> tag is found in the head element. It contains the title that you would see in the URL area of a web browser.
  - Source Code- The source code is the code that a website comes from. You can use the view source command to open it in a new tab

#### Extra Markup
  - Doctypes- This is a declaration at the beginning of a document that tells the browser which version of html is being used
  - Comments- A comment in your code is a section that can only be visible from the code of your document. It does not show in the website. It is used to explain or add comments for programmers to use and understand what is happening, like a side note. You can add a comment by typing: <!-- comment goes here -->
