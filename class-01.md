## Read: 01 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript

### HTML & CSS

#### Structure
  - Tags- they include an opening and closing tag. They are like containers for the information inbetween the opening and closing tags.
  - Attributes- they provide extra information about the contents within the designated tags. They are inserted into the opening tag. Attributes include an atribute name and an attribute value. The name identifies what is being changed in the element and the value is what kind of change is being made.

  - Body- The <Body> tag contains elements in the main browser window.
  - Head- The <head> tag is where you put information about a page. For example, the title element is found within the head tag.
  - Tittle- the <title> tag is found in the head element. It contains the title that you would see in the URL area of a web browser.
  - Source Code- The source code is the code that a website comes from. You can use the view source command to open it in a new tab

#### Extra Markup
  - Doctypes- This is a declaration at the beginning of a document that tells the browser which version of html is being used
  - Comments- A comment in your code is a section that can only be visible from the code of your document. It does not show in the website. It is used to explain or add comments for programmers to use and understand what is happening, like a side note. You can add a comment by typing: <!-- comment goes here -->
  - ID Attribute- The id attribute is used to assign a unique identifier to an element. It allows you to individually apply styles with CSS.
  - Class Attribute- Similar to the ID Atribute but can be assigned to multyple elements for quick styling of many elements.
  - Block Elements- Block level elements are elements that start on a new line in the browser. Similar to how pharagraphs are divided.
  - Inline Elements- Inline elements will continue on from the last inline element, similar to how sentances continue on from eachother. 
  - Div Element- The <div> element groups a set of elements together in one block level box.
  - Span Element- The <span> element is like the div element but the inline version.
  - iFrames- an <iframe> is used to imbed a web page or section of a web page into your web page.
  - Meta- The <meta> element is in the head element. It is the metadata of your website.
