## HTML & CSS

### Structure

  - **_Tags_**- they include an opening and closing tag. They are like containers for the information inbetween the opening and closing tags.
  - **_Attributes_**- they provide extra information about the contents within the designated tags. They are inserted into the opening tag. Attributes include an atribute name and an attribute value. The name identifies what is being changed in the element and the value is what kind of change is being made.
