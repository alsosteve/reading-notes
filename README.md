## Growth Mindset
__*Growth mindset*__ is having the maturity to **analyze challenges** in your life and being able to work through them in a **positive and productive** way.
To remember growth mindset I will:
- take a step back and disect a problem so I can analyze each step.
- find out where I went wrong so I can learn how to avoid or be prepared for similar challenges in the future.
- look at other who are successful as peers who challenge my own skills or even distant mentors.
