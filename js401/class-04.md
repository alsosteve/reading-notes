## Advantages of test driven development:
1. Better code quality
2. Keep track of your end goal
3. More modular

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
You use one before and the other after the test.

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development?
You have to write the tests out before you start codeing.

## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

Easier than SOAP.

class: how you creaate an object template.

super: how to call functions of a parent

this: refers to the object it is in
