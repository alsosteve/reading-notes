### [Component Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)
**_Component Based Architecture_** breaks down how a page is designed into functional or logical components that represent communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties. It divides problems into sub-problems. The primary objective is component reusability. 
Advantages are as follows:
* Reduced time time and cost by reusing existing components
* Increase in reliability with reused components

A **_Component_** is a software object that is modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable. Itâ€™s interface is defined by recommended behavior. It can work with other components.
It can be viewed in 3 ways:
1. Object-oriented - This viewing method shows components as one or more cooperating classes. 
2. Conventional - This shows functional elements or a program model.
3. Process-related -  builds from existing components in a library.

The characteristics are:
* reusability
* replacability
* not context specific
* extensible
* encapsulated
* independent
