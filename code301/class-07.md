### [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)
1. Roy Fielding helped write the first web server that sent documents across the internet. He also wrote about how the internet works.
2. The techniques that we use today donâ€™t work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world because the techniques developers used to get computers to talk to each other did not meet the requirements to do so when it was being made.
3. Fielding and his team created the HTTP protocol is based around applying verbs to nouns.
4. Get retrieves data.
5. Post creates new resources.
6. Put updates original resources with newly updated representations.
7. Patch only send the data that we need to modify without modifying or effecting other parts of the data.
