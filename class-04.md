## HTML & CSS

### Links
A **_Link_** is an element within a webpage that allows you to travel to another webpage. They are found between the **_<a>_** tags.
<a href="http://www.website.com">Link text</a>

When linking pages on the same sit you canuse a **_relative_** URL instead of a full URL. This is just the end part of the URL.

A **_Directory_** is a folder in a repository. You sould organize by placing the pages for each diffrent section of the site in a new folder.
